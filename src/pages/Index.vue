          We are convening partners for the Office of Creative Space
          collaborative. If you're a Toronto-based arts nonprofit, creative
          social enterprise, or supportive individual or business, we'd love to
          have you involved.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Permanent space for small arts organizations has long been out of
          reach in Toronto. At the whims of a meteoric commercial market, and
          facing the extreme scarcity of affordable space managed by local
          government and through short-term rental programs, vital arts groups
          have been forced to cease operations for lack of secure space for
          decades.
        </p>

        <p>
          Real estate development disproportionately displaces Black and other
          racialized communities, and projects that promise space for culture
          primarily benefit new, higher-income residents and investors rather
          than existing communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the market escalates, community asset ownership and governance will
          keep our neighbourhoods vital and viable.
        </p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>

        <p>
          We envision a near future where every Toronto neighborhood with
          community-owned spaces where residents can create, experience and
          learn about visual and media art enjoys stabilized property values,
          thriving microeconomies, and strong connections between residents,
          artists and a constellation of community organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than mega-investments into risky, large central hubs, we see a
          decentralized network of smaller spaces that are contextually
          sensitive to the neighbourhoods in which they are situated – sized to
          make operating costs manageable by local community trusts working in
          partnership with artist stewards.
        </p>

        <p>
          In an unrestrained commercial market, artists and creators will seek
          equitable and community-centred models for production and exhibition
          space that allow meaningful connection to local neighbourhoods
          –&nbsp;rather than relying on community benefit agreements to
          materialize years after big developments tear holes in the
          streetscape.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the future, every artist in Toronto will be able to find adequate
          affordable workspace in their home neighbourhood, and have all the
          resources they need to thrive in their practice and in their
          communities. Arts organizations will be supported in fundraising and
          planning efforts as they seek space for their members and communities.
          Artists, community and arts organizations will leverage the financial
          and creative control they have to improve conditions for the whole
          community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artists and community members freely share their needs and feedback to
          improve spaces and the network for all, and feel a strong connection
          to the shared resources, assets and people in their communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          We see a near future where a sustainable system has been established
          that reliably improves the ability of communities to increase asset
          ownership and ensure local social resilience.

        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          Backbone organization the
          <a href="https://www.tomediaarts.org/">Toronto Media Arts Cluster</a>
          (TMAC) was first conceptualized in 2003, after almost 15 years of
          organizing and theorizing solutions to the problem of affordable,
          permanent space for artists in the City of Toronto. The organization
          incorporated in 2011 and attained charitable status in 2013.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2014, with the support of the local community, City staff,
          neighbourhood advocacy groups and our local city councillor, TMAC,
          Urbancorp and the City of Toronto finalized an agreement that would
          provide the developer a density bonus in exchange for a turnkey,
          purpose-built, 38,000 sq. ft. facility for TMAC. However, the
          developer failed to complete construction of the space on time and
          eventually went bankrupt; TMAC was forced to engage in a lawsuit to
          operate the space on an interim basis. We moved into our facility in
          March 2018, and, unable to fundraise money required in a settlement
          due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lost our lawsuit in November 2020. TMAC
          and its member orgs were forced to move out in July 2021. (<a

            target="_blank"
            >Read the whole tale here.</a
          >)
        </p>

        <p>
          In its 2+ years of operation at the 32 Lisgar site, TMAC organically
          grew into an integrated collaborative organization supporting its
          members, the West Queen West community, and all of Toronto’s media
          artists and artist-run centres with a particular focus on queer,
          gender-marginalized, Black and racialized artists. As a community
          benefit, TMAC’s programming brought vital jobs, education, and
          stability to the neighbourhood; generated income for businesses in the
          area through regular public events; and brought all of the social
          benefits of engaging with the arts directly to the local community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our collaborators believe the collective impact approach is crucial to
          the success of the Office of Creative Space, as every aspect requires
          thoughtful collaboration with all stakeholders centred on equity.
          Having worked together for years on various programs and projects,
          including failures and successes, our vision for a network of
          community-owned, artist-stewarded spaces across the City is shared
          despite the varying needs and resources of each partner. Our goal is
          to develop a model replicable not only across the GTA, but across
          Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>Model</h2>

        <p>
          Using social finance investment tools, we purchase real estate in the
          GTA to sell to community arts land trusts and co-ops on favourable
          terms, stabilizing space costs in an escalating market. We also plan
          to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide training, mentorship, and HR support to arts nonprofits and
            collectives to support the development of sustainable financial and
            governance models
          </li>
          <li>Develop and manage a community algorithmic trust.</li>
          <li>
            Develop partnerships with social enterprises to anchor spaces and
            diversify revenue models for community-owned assets.
          </li>
          <li>
            In collaboration with arts organizations and artists, collect data,
            measure results and publish reports on barriers (structural,
            ethical, financial) and solutions to permanent space for artists in
            Canada.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advocate at all levels of government for increased direct supports
            to arts organizations operating community spaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop a coalition of smaller-scale, infill developers focused on
            meeting the affordable housing and economic development needs of
            communities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assist arts and community groups’ capitalization to acquire real
            estate.
          </li>
        </ul>
